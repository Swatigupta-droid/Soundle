                    <p style="text-align: left;">The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when 
                        we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, 
                        propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for 
                        different ways or truer answers.</p>

                        when they look at you, but if you yourself don't know it, all of that doesn't even matter. 
                        Every second that you spend on doubting your worth, every moment that you use to criticize 
                        yourself; is a second of your life wasted, is a moment of your life thrown away. It's not 
                        like you have forever, so don't waste any of your seconds, don't throw even one of your 
                        moments away.</q>
