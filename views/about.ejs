               <h3>What do you mean by deaf-mute?</h3>
               <br><br>
               <p>
                Deaf-mute is a term which was used historically to identify a person who was either deaf and used 
                sign language or both deaf and could not speak. The term continues to be used to refer to deaf 
                people who cannot speak an oral language or have some degree of speaking ability, but choose not 
                to speak because of the negative or unwanted attention atypical voices sometimes attract. 
                Such people communicate using sign language.[1] Some consider it to be a derogatory term if used 
                outside its historical context; the preferred term today is simply "deaf".
               </p>
                <p>
                  It often comes as a surprise that many deaf individuals refer to themselves as being members of
                  the Deaf community and ascribe to Deaf culture. These individuals view themselves as a unique
                  cultural and linguistic minority who use sign language as their primary language. The characteristics
                  of Deaf culture are formed out of many shared life experiences rooted in a visual world designed for
                  communication ease.

              <h3>What is American Sign Language?</h3>
              <br><br>
              <p>Sign languages differ across countries and even within regions. There is no universal sign
                language. In America, the Deaf community uses American Sign Language (ASL). ASL is a complete,
                grammatically complex language. The National Association of the Deaf explains that in ASL, “the
                shape, placement, and movement of the hands, as well as facial expressions and body movements,
                all play important parts in conveying information.”1
                 ASL is not a communication code designed to
                represent English</p>

                <p>Attaining proficiency in ASL mirrors that of other spoken languages. Proficiency requires extensive
                  instruction and immersion in the culture and language. In terms of ASL, this occurs with ongoing use
                  at home, in school, and/or with members of the Deaf community. </p>

                            highlight lighting, both adequate and creative; open floor plans; and spatial positioning of

                      <h3>Do all deaf individuals identify with Deaf culture?</h3>
                      <br><br>
                  <p>Not all deaf individuals identify with Deaf culture. Though some individuals fully embrace all aspects
                    of Deaf culture and community, others may identify only marginally or not at all. Identity is a highly
                    personal process that is always evolving.</p>

                  <p>Deaf individuals undergo many changes in their beliefs and identity as they mature from childhood
                    into adulthood, including how they self-identify in terms of their hearing loss. Some individuals
                    discover Deaf culture for the first time as adolescents or young adults and make a conscious decision
                    to be a part of the Deaf community</p>

              There is no longer a foreign language requirement at the University of Rochester. With regard to departmental foreign language requirements, students should speak to their academic advisor.</p>
            <p >
              There is some ongoing controversy surrounding the issue of whether or not ASL should fulfill foreign language requirements. For more information on this subject, Sherman Wilcox at the University of New Mexico has compiled information regarding the most common objections and answers to these questions with facts from the linguistic, anthropological, and other research literatures. </p>

              Research by Lane, Hoffmeister and Bahan suggests in a study, publish in 1996, that ASL ranks after Spanish, Italian, German and French in sequence of highest percentage in use, and if English the most commonly used language is excluded.
              They suggest that ASL ranks six in the USA with estimated users in the order of 500,000 to 2,000,000 signers (speakers). Harlan Lane, Robert Hoffmeister, and Ben Bahan - A journey into the deaf-world (San Diego, Calif.: DawnSignPress, 1996, p.42).</p>

              The choice of communication media is not merely vested in the deaf person's preferences, 
              but to a greater extent in the fact that deafness is mostly diagnosed at a younger age, where 
              nine out of ten hearing guardians choose the way they seem fit.
              Therefore the correct information must be available concerning the total spectrum of a life without 
              hearing. This responsibility rests solely with the organizations catering in this subject and more so,
               organizations operating not to profit of which NAD (National Association of the Deaf) in the US is the 
               most prominent.</p>
